# Breast-Cancer-Detection

A Machine Learning project for Breast Cancer detection.
Number of attributes under consideration are 11 and there are 699 entries.
Attributes under consideration :  id,clump_thickness,uniform_cell_size,uniform_cell_shape,marginal_adhesion,single_epithelial_size,bare_nuclei,bland_chromatin,normal_nucleoli,mitoses,class
Breast Cancer Detection using K-Nearst Neighbors and Support Vector algorithms.
There are two classes (2 and 4) which are used to determine results.
Class 2 stands for Benign (Non Cancerous)
Class 4 stands for Malignant (Cancerous)
Results obtained using the both the algorithms are compared using precision,recall values and F1 scores.
Accuracy score obtained using KNN is 98.28%
Accuracy score obtained using SVM is 97.142%.
Dataset is obtained from the UCI repository.
