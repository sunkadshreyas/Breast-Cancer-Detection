# Breast-Cancer-Detection

A Machine Learning project for Breast Cancer detection.<br />
Dataset is obtained from the UCI repository.  <br />
Number of attributes under consideration are 11 and there are 699 entries. <br />
Attributes under consideration :
<ul>
  <li>clump_thickness</li>
  <li>uniform_cell_size</li>
  <li>uniform_cell_shape</li>
  <li>marginal_adhesion</li>
  <li>single_epithelial_size</li>
  <li>bare_nuclei</li>
  <li>bland_chromatin</li>
  <li>normal_nucleoli</li>
</ul>
Breast Cancer Detection using K-Nearst Neighbors and Support Vector algorithms. <br />
There are two classes (2 and 4) which are used to determine results.<br />
Class 2 stands for Benign (Non Cancerous) <br />
Class 4 stands for Malignant (Cancerous) <br />
Results obtained using the both the algorithms are compared using precision,recall values and F1 scores.<br />
Accuracy score obtained using KNN is 98.28% <br />
Accuracy score obtained using SVM is 97.142%. <br />
